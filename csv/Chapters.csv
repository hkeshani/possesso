The Farnese family traces their roots as far back the 11th century from the area near Lake Bolsena in northern Lazio. Although the Farnese belonged to the military aristocracy, the Church was the source of its fortune. Paul III’s grandfather served under Pope Eugenius IV (Gabriele Condulmer, r.1431-1437), who substantially increased the family landholdings and secured the family’s social standing among the Roman nobility.<br><br>

There is some debate surrounding Paul III’s birthplace. Sources record he was born in Viterbo or Canino (in northern Lazio); however, papal biographers assert he was born in Rome. The question of identity is central to Paul III’s political persona. He was the first Roman to become pope in over a hundred years, and both he and the Popolo Romano, the city magistrates, were eager to accept this created identity. The crafting of Paul III’s person began early in his pontificate with his Possesso.

Leonardo Bufalini was an experienced surveyor and military engineer from the northern Italian city of Udine.  His understanding of Rome's topography came directly from working on the city's fortifications under Paul III. It was under the Farnese pontificate that Bufalini completed the surveying work to produce this map. According to Antonio Trevisi da Lecce, Bufalini spent seven years collecting the necessary data, which places the genesis of the map in the 1540s at the height of Paul III's reign.

Therefore, the experience of a procession is complex: in our minds, we are guided by a mental map of the whole route, while our direct encounter with the built environment can only be with its parts. Associations between the Zecca and the Arch of Titus allow the parade participant to superimpose these monuments mentally, perceive them simultaneously, and illustrate the conceptual notion of palimpsest.<br><br>

Rome becomes the manuscript. The city’s epochal urban transformations are additive, each historic period grafted onto the previous like text. With each passage, the previous layer of writing is effaced, if only in part, to accommodate the next. Freud likens the Roman architectural palimpsest to the study of memory. In both instances, “everything survives in some way or other, and is capable under certain conditions of being brought to light again.”
